# Content-Aware-Image-Resizing-with-Seam-Carving


ABSTRACT: The process of adding or removing pixels in the image cannot be performed at random. Addition or removal of pixels in the image at random positions would create a distorted image. If we add or remove whole rows or columns with minimal energy, artifacts might arise in the picture. The solution is seam carving which were proposed by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir. Therefore, the goal of this project is to perform content-aware image resizing for both reduction and expansion with seam carving method. This allows image to be resized without losing or distorting meaningful content from scaling.
